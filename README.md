## Description

The aim of this project is to create a Quiz for the user to select from multiple choice answers to questions about Javascript.

The following acceptance criteria was set for the project :

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

        * A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
        * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
   
        * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
   
    * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

    * The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

    * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

During the process of working on this project I have learned more about the javascript coding, including the use of arrays of objects, timers, local storage, element creation, random numbers and event handling. 

Furthermore, I have become a little more familiar with working with GitHub and ReadMe files.
